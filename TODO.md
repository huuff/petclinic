# Tasks
* At least 70% coverage
* Use slugs for outgoing properties?
* Building links in views with static methods like `OwnerController.redirectToOwnerView` (Or something similar)
* What about updates (merging only properties that aren't null) directly in the models? This kills the anemic models antipattern
* Add RememberMe, use full authentication for CUD
* See if I can use `mapstruct` for form converters
* My own login form
* Try to edit a vet and remove first name and last name, the result is an empty header. What do I do?
* Add the option to appoint a new visit for an owner in front page
* Show different colors for visits in accordion depending on whether they are today, upcoming or passed.
* Allow option for a vet to add a comment to a visit
* Request vets to comment all past visits
* Notify vets of newly appointed visits
* Top header fragment
* Some way of telling an owner he doesn't have any pets and to add one
* Sign up in index body instead of navbar?
* Block login for an account on 3 password failures
* It really looks like visits should be called appointments
