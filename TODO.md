# Tasks
* Allow only vets to access `/owners`
* Allow modifying owner info from `/owners`
* Show link to `/owners` in `index` for vets
* Test every repository with custom logic
* Add `findById`s. Test them.
* Append `ID` to all foreign key columns
* Look into using coroutines in kotlin?
* `r2dbc` queries induce much suffering, try `jOOQ`?
* Stop using `R2dbcRepository` for composite entities. There's almost nothing to win from it and it's too much pain when it stops detecting them
