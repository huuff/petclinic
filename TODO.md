* Get auto-reloading with dev tools
* Separate data and web as maven projects
* Add login, owner profile, etc
* Add button to appoint a visit for an owner after logging in
* Use maven release plugin
* Use `@ModelAttribute`. UPDATE: None of my controller methods are suitable for this, but I'm leaving the todo for the future
* Add validation messages to all forms
* Add pet form not working. UPDATE: It's because `owner` is null. Fix it with a backing bean
