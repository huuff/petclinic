# Tasks
* Allow only vets to access `/owners`
* Allow modifying owner info from `/owners`
* Show link to `/owners` in `index` for vets
* Test every repository with custom logic
* Add `findById`s. Test them.
* An abstract base entity class?
* Append `ID` to all foreign key columns
* Look into using coroutines in kotlin?
* `r2dbc` queries induce much suffering, try `jOOQ`?
* Use the maven spring kotlin plugin. Really important since otherwise I'm getting NPEs all around
* Set transaction on save methods
