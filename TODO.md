* Get auto-reloading with dev tools
* Separate data and web as maven projects
* Add login, owner profile, etc
* Add button to appoint a visit for an owner after logging in
* Use maven release plugin
* Use `@ModelAttribute`. UPDATE: None of my controller methods are suitable for this, but I'm leaving the todo for the future
* Use the model name (Vet name, owner name, pet name...) in the templates instead a generic `Pet` or `Owner` or `Vet`
* A template for person forms that already adds firstname and lastname
