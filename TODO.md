* At least 70% coverage
* Show some info regarding a 403 error
* Column names on every entity?
* Use slugs for outgoing properties?
* Add HTML validations
* Building links in views with static methods like `OwnerController.redirectToOwnerView` (Or something similar)

* All bodies in some container
* Don't ask confirmation for logout
