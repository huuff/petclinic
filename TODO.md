# Tasks
* Get autoreload with devtools working
* Add language switcher
* At least 70% coverage
* Show some info regarding a 403 error
* Put some "Go back home" link in every page
* Column names on every entity?
* Use slugs for outgoing properties?
* Add wrap `th`s in `tr`s
* Add HTML validations
* Building links in views with static methods like `OwnerController.redirectToOwnerView` (Or something similar)
* What about updates (merging only properties that aren't null) directly in the models? This kills the anemic models antipattern
* Some magic with lombok's `@ToString` to get better logged entities?
