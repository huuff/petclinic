# Tasks
* At least 70% coverage
* Use slugs for outgoing properties?
* Building links in views with static methods like `OwnerController.redirectToOwnerView` (Or something similar)
* What about updates (merging only properties that aren't null) directly in the models? This kills the anemic models antipattern
* Add RememberMe, use full authentication for CUD
* See if I can use `mapstruct` for form converters
* My own login form
* Try to edit a vet and remove first name and last name, the result is an empty header. What do I do?
